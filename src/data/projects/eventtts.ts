  overview:
    "Eventtts is a comprehensive event management system tailored for CHRIST University, allowing students and faculty to create, manage, and track events with a user-friendly interface.",
  challenges: [
    "Designing a system that supports nested events within main events.",
    "Implementing an interactive timetable with real-time updates.",
    "Optimizing database queries for quick event retrieval and updates.",
  ],
  solution:
    "Next.js was chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, ensuring quick loading times. MongoDB was used to structure events efficiently with a nested document approach. The app included a drag-and-drop event scheduler and real-time push notifications for updates.",
  outcome:
    "The system streamlined event organization, increasing event participation by 30% and reducing scheduling conflicts through efficient real-time updates.",
};
