In recent years, Tailwind CSS has revolutionized the way we approach web design and development. This utility-first CSS framework has gained massive popularity due to its flexibility and developer-friendly approach. Let's dive into some essential best practices that will help you make the most of Tailwind CSS.

## 3. Custom Configuration

Tailwind's configuration file is powerful and flexible. Some best practices include:
