  content: `# Performance Optimization Techniques in Next.js

Optimizing performance in Next.js applications is crucial for providing the best user experience. Let's explore various techniques to enhance your app's performance.

## Image Optimization

Next.js provides built-in image optimization:

\`\`\`jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

function MyImage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/my-image.jpg"
      alt="Description"
      width={500}
      height={300}
      priority
    />
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Code Splitting

Implement effective code splitting:

- Dynamic imports
- Route-based splitting
- Component-level splitting

## Lazy Loading

Use lazy loading for better initial load times:

\`\`\`jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/Heavy'))
\`\`\`

## Caching Strategies

Implement proper caching:

- Static page generation
- Incremental Static Regeneration
- Stale-While-Revalidate

## Performance Monitoring

Always monitor your application's performance:

- Core Web Vitals
- Lighthouse scores
- Real user metrics

Remember, performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly audit your application and make necessary improvements.`,
