    problem: "Traditional question paper generation is time-consuming and may not cover all learning objectives effectively.",
    methodology: "We implemented and compared three different approaches: LSA, Word2Vec, and Seq2Seq models.",
    results: "The Seq2Seq model showed a 15% improvement in question relevance compared to traditional methods.",
    conclusion: "AI-powered question generation shows promising results for automating and improving educational assessment.",
